        Please read through the information sheet below and then proceed to book a convenient time slot using the "book experiment" button. Although the duration of the time slots is set to 30 minutes the experiment should not take more than 15-20 minutes. You will be compensated with a £5 Amazon voucher for your time.

      <br><br>
      <h5> 1.	What is the purpose of this research? </h5>
      <br>
      <p> There is a significant body of research on authenticating or identifying individuals based on how they interact with touchscreen-enabled devices (e.g., smartphones or tablets). This process is typically based on manually extracting features of swipes (e.g., speed and curvature) and taps (e.g., coordinates and hold time).</p>
      <p>The goal of this project is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate feature extraction and selection. Compared to previous work, this requires data from significantly more individuals.</p>
      <p>You will be handed a research smartphone and asked to complete a simple swiping task (e.g., an image comparison game or social media feed). We then collect raw touchscreen and phone sensor data along with baic user information.</p>
      <br>
      <h5> 2.	Why have I been invited to take part? </h5>
      <br>
      <p>You have been invited because you indicated an interest in the study.</p>
      <br>
      <h5> 3.	Do I have to take part? </h5>
      <br>
      <p> No.  You can ask questions about the research before deciding whether or not to participate. If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw yourself from the study at any time, without giving a reason, by advising the researchers of this decision. </p>
      <br>

      <h5>4.	What will happen to me if I take part in the research?</h5>
      <br>
      <p>You will be handed a research smartphone and asked to complete a simple swiping task (e.g., an image comparison game or social media feed). We then collect raw touchscreen and phone sensor data along with baic user information.</p>
      <br>

      <h5>5.	Are there any potential risks in taking part?</h5>
      <br>
      <p>The experiment is similar to day-to-day interactions with smartphones. As such, there are no significant risks in taking part.</p>
      <br>

      <h5>6.	Are there any benefits in taking part?</h5>
      <br>
      <p>You will be compensated with a £5 Amazon voucher for your time.</p>
      <br>

      <h5>7.	What happens to the data provided?</h5>
      <br>
      <p>The information you provide as part of the study is the research data.  Any research data from which you can be identified is known as personal data. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
      <p>We will minimise our use of personal data in the study as much as possible.
      The only personal information taken from you in this study as part of the consent form will be your name, surname and email address. These will be kept confidentially within the research group and they will be stored on paper at the Department of Computer Science.
      In addition, we will collect basic demographic information (e.g. age, gender, handedness).</p>

      <p>The research team will have access to personal/research data.  Responsible members of the University of Oxford may be given access to data for monitoring and/or audit of the research.</p>

      <p>All research data will be stored for at least 3 years after publication or public release of the work of the research. We may retain and store your personal data for an additional period of time as necessary for the purposes of the study, and for further research.
      We would like your permission to share research data with other researchers (e.g. in online databases).  All personal information that could identify you will be removed or changed before information is shared with other researchers or results are made public.</p>
          <br>
      <h5>8.	Will the research be published?</h5>
          <br>
      <p>The research resulting from this study may be published in a peer-reviewed journal, at a peer-reviewed research conference and in data repositories for research in the field of System Security research. All data and measurements will only be published in anonymised form which makes it impossible to trace back to the participant’s identity.</p>

      <p>The University of Oxford is committed to the dissemination of its research for the benefit of society and the economy and, in support of this commitment, has established an online archive of research materials. This archive includes digital copies of student theses successfully submitted as part of a University of Oxford postgraduate degree programme. Holding the archive online gives easy access for researchers to the full text of freely available theses, thereby increasing the likely impact and use of that research.</p>

      <p>The research will be written up as a thesis. On successful submission of the thesis, it will be deposited both in print and online in the University archives, to facilitate its use in future research. The thesis will be openly accessible.</p>
    <br>
      <h5>9.	Who is organising and funding the research?</h5>
          <br>
      <p>This research is funded by the Department of Computer Science and Mastercard.</p>
    <br>
      <h5>10.	Who has reviewed this study?</h5>
          <br>
      <p>This study has been reviewed by, and received ethics clearance through, the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee.</p>
    <br>
      <h5>11.	Who do I contact if I have a concern about the study or I wish to complain?</h5>
          <br>
      <p>If you have a concern about any aspect of this study, please speak to the relevant researcher (martin.georgiev@cybersecurity.ox.ac.uk) or their supervisor (ivan.martinovic@cs.ox.ac.uk), who will do their best to answer your query. The researcher should acknowledge your concern within 10 working days and give you an indication of how they intend to deal with it. If you remain unhappy or wish to make a formal complaint, please contact the relevant chair of the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford who will seek to resolve the matter in a reasonably expeditious manner:</p>

      <p>Chair, University of Oxford Computer Science Ethics Committee: Andrew Martin
